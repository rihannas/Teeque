## Model Overview

This Django application includes custom models for handling user accounts, roles, services, orders, and reviews. The `CustomUser` model is extended from Djangoâ€™s default `AbstractUser` to support email-based authentication. Additional models include `Seller`, `Buyer`, `Service`, `Order`, `OrderItem`, `Category`, `Tag`, and `Rating`, which define the core features of the platform.

Here's a table that summarizes the Django models:

| **Model**      | **Fields**                                                                                                                                          | **Relationships**                                                             | **Notes**                                                                                               |

### Key

- **One-to-one relationship:** Each `CustomUser` can be a `Seller` or a `Buyer`.
- **ForeignKey relationship:** Models like `Service`, `Order`, and `OrderItem` reference other models (e.g., `Seller`, `Category`, `Order`).
- **Many-to-many relationship:** Models like `Service` and `Buyer` can have multiple relationships through tags or favorite services.

This table provides a clear overview of the models, fields, and their relationships.
